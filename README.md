## General Introduction

The social movement Black Lives Matter (BLM) began in 2013 in the USA. The mission of its supporter is to defeat white supremacy and police brutality against black people. After African-American George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis during a violent arrest on the 25th May 2020, BLM protests also took place in Australia, Asia and Europe, which made the national social movement become global.
The goal of this paper is to get insight into how racism and violence can lead to rebellion in the population.

## The Model

To analyse the behaviour of the population, we chose a model based on the one proposed in the Epstein paper (see References). In order to get insight into racism and violence, we developed two different models out of the original model used by Epstein.
The goal of the first model is to simulate discrimination. In order to do this, the agents are split between two different groups. Each agent gets an additional variable for the experienced discrimination. That variable is based on the amount of arrests for one group compared to all arrests.
For the second model the goal is to analyse violent police behavior. To do this, the legitimacy is changed for each agent based on his experience with the police (violent or not violent). The police is split in two parts, one violent one and one quiet one. Violent police officers will decrease the legitimacy for all people around him, while good ones will improve it by a small bit.

## Fundamental Questions

* How does discrimination affects Epstein's model?
* Can we simulate the effect of that police brutality has on protests?
* If we use realitstic data, how does the model behave?

## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)

## Research Methods

Goal is to implement two agent-based model based on the model of Epstein in the provided paper to simulate different scenarios regarding discrimination and police brutality. For this, the model of Epstein was developed further.
